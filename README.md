**Breaking news (pun intended): ggOceanMaps goes
[sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)!** Most of ggOceanMaps code has
been rewritten. There are plenty of new features in v2 (see
[this](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/ggOceanMaps/articles/new-features.html)),
but likely also many new bugs. Please [report them
here](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps/issues).

## Overview

The ggOceanMaps package for [R](https://www.r-project.org/) allows
plotting data on bathymetric maps using
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference). The package is
designed for ocean sciences and greatly simplifies bathymetric map
plotting anywhere around the globe. ggOceanMaps uses openly available
geographic data. Citing the particular data sources is advised by the
CC-BY licenses whenever maps from the package are published (see the
[*Citations and data sources*](#citations-and-data-sources) section).

The ggOceanMaps package has been developed by the [Institute of Marine
Research](https://www.hi.no/en). Note that the package comes with
absolutely no warranty and that maps generated by the package are meant
for plotting scientific data only. The maps are coarse generalizations
of third-party data and therefore inaccurate. Any [bug reports and code
fixes](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps/issues) are warmly
welcomed. See [*Contributions*](#contributions) for further details.

## Installation

The package is available on
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggOceanMaps) and as a [GitHub
version](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps), which is
updated more frequently than the CRAN version.

Installation of the GitHub version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps")
```

Installation of the CRAN version:

``` r
install.packages("ggOceanMaps")
```

The new 2.0 version of ggOceanMaps does not require the ggOceanMapsData
package any longer. Detailed map data are downloaded when needed from
the [ggOceanMapsLargeData](#data-path) repository.

## Usage

**ggOceanMaps** extends on
[**ggplot2**](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/). The package uses
spatial ([**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)) shape- (e.g. vector)
and ([**stars**](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/)) raster files,
[geospatial packages for
R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) to manipulate, and
ggplot2 to plot these data. The vector and raster plotting is conducted
internally in the `basemap` function, which uses [ggplot’s sf object
plotting
capabilities](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html). Maps
are plotted using the `basemap()` or `qmap()` functions that work almost
similarly to [`ggplot()` as a
base](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) for adding
further layers to the plot using the `+` operator. The maps generated
this way already contain multiple ggplot layers. Consequently, the
[`data` argument](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html)
needs to be explicitly specified inside `geom_*` functions when adding
`ggplot2` layers. Depending on the location of the map, the underlying
coordinates may be projected. Decimal degree coordinates need to be
transformed to the projected coordinates using the `transform_coord`,
[ggspatial](https://paleolimbot.github.io/ggspatial/), or [`geom_sf`
functions.](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html)

``` r
library(ggOceanMaps)

dt <- data.frame(lon = c(-30, -30, 30, 30), lat = c(50, 80, 80, 50))

basemap(data = dt, bathymetry = TRUE) + 
  geom_polygon(data = transform_coord(dt), aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
               color = "red", fill = NA)
```

website](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/ggOceanMaps/index.html),
[function
reference](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/ggOceanMaps/reference/index.html),
and the [user
manual](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/ggOceanMaps/articles/ggOceanMaps.html)
for how to use and modify the maps plotted by the package. You may also
find [these slides about the
package](https://aen-r-workshop.github.io/4-ggOceanMaps/ggOceanMaps_workshop.html#1)
useful.

## Data path

While ggOceanMaps allows plotting any custom-made shapefiles, the
package contains a shortcut to plot higher resolution maps for [certain
areas needed by the
author](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/ggOceanMaps/articles/premade-maps.html)
without the need of generating the shapefiles manually. These
high-resolution shapefiles are downloaded from the
[ggOceanMapsLargeData](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMapsLargeData)
repository. As a default, the shapefiles are downloaded into a temporary
directory meaning that the user would need to download the large
shapefiles every time they restart R. This limitation is set by [CRAN
policies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html). You
can define a custom folder for high-resolution shapefiles on your
computer by modifying your .Rprofile file
(e.g. `usethis::edit_r_profile()`). Add the following lines to the file:

``` r
.ggOceanMapsenv <- new.env()
.ggOceanMapsenv$datapath <- 'YourCustomPath'
```

It is smart to use a directory R has writing access to. For example
`"~/ggOceanMapsLargeData"` would work for most operating systems.

You will need to set up the data path to your .Rprofile file only once
and ggOceanMaps will find the path even though you updated your R or
packages. ggOceanMaps will inform you about your data path when you load
the package.
