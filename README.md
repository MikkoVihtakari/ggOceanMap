**Plot data on oceanographic maps using ggplot2. R package version
0.4.3**

## Overview

The ggOceanMaps package for [R](https://www.r-project.org/) allows
plotting data on bathymetric maps using
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference). The package is
designed for ocean sciences and greatly simplifies bathymetric map
plotting anywhere around the globe. ggOceanMaps uses openly available
geographic data. Citing the particular data sources is advised by the
CC-BY licenses whenever maps from the package are published (see the
[*Citations and data sources*](#citations-and-data-sources) section).

ggOceanMaps has been developed by the [Institute of Marine
Research](https://www.hi.no/en). The package is a continuation of the
work by the lead author with the
[PlotSvalbard](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard) package,
which could not be uploaded to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) due
to package size limitations and was designed for a limited region. The
sole purpose of ggOceanMaps is to allow the installation from CRAN and
to expand the mapping capabilities for the entire world.

Note that the package comes with absolutely no warranty and that maps
generated by the package are meant for plotting scientific data only.
The maps are coarse generalizations of third party data and therefore
inaccurate. Any [bug reports and code
fixes](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps/issues) are warmly
welcomed. See [*Contributions*](#contributions) for further details.

## Installation

The package comes in three versions with different update cycles: 1) the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) version is updated infrequently (a
few times a year), 2) The
[drat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drat/index.html) version
is updated when major features are added or bad bugs fixed, and 3) the
GitHub version is updated whenever the author works with the package.

When available, the CRAN version can be installed using
`install.packages("ggOceanMaps")`. A more frequently updated drat
version of the package can be installed as follows:

``` r
install.packages("ggOceanMaps", repos = c("https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/drat", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Due to the package size limitations, ggOceanMaps requires the
[ggOceanMapsData](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMapsData)
package which stores the shapefiles and should be installed
automatically when ggOceanMaps is loaded. Note that actual installation
size of the package is larger (about 35 Mb) than stated on CRAN due to
shapefiles used by ggOceanMaps.

Frequently updated developmental version can be installed using the
[**devtools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html)
package.

``` r
devtools::install_github("MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMapsData") # required by ggOceanMaps
devtools::install_github("MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps")
```

If you encounter problems during the devtools installation, you may set
the `upgrade` argument to `"never"` and try the following steps:

1.  Manually update all R packages you have installed (Packages -\>
    Update -\> Select all -\> Install updates in R Studio). If an update
    of a package fails, try installing that package again using the
    `install.packages` function or the R Studio menu.
2.  Run `devtools::install_github("MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps", upgrade
    = "never")`.
3.  If installation of a dependency fails, try installing that package
    manually and repeat step 2.
4.  Since R has lately been updated to 4.0, you may have to update your
    R to the latest major version for all dependencies to work (`stars`,
    `rgdal` and `sf` have been reported to cause trouble during the
    installation).

## Usage

**ggOceanMaps** extends on
[**ggplot2**](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/). The package uses
spatial shapefiles, [GIS packages for
R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) to manipulate, and
the
[**ggspatial**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggspatial/index.html)
package to help to plot these shapefiles. The shapefile plotting is
conducted internally in the `basemap` function and uses [ggplotâ€™s sf
object plotting
capabilities](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html). Maps
are plotted using the `basemap()` or `qmap()` functions that work almost
similarly to [`ggplot()` as a
base](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) for adding
further layers to the plot using the `+` operator. The maps generated
this way already contain multiple ggplot layers. Consequently, the
[`data` argument](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html)
needs to be explicitly specified inside `geom_*` functions when adding
`ggplot2` layers. Depending on the location of the map, the underlying
coordinates may be projected. Decimal degree coordinates need to be
transformed to the projected coordinates using the `transform_coord`,
[ggspatial](https://paleolimbot.github.io/ggspatial/), or [`geom_sf`
functions.](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html)

``` r
library(ggOceanMaps)

dt <- data.frame(lon = c(-30, -30, 30, 30), lat = c(50, 80, 80, 50))

basemap(data = dt, bathymetry = TRUE) + 
  geom_polygon(data = transform_coord(dt), aes(x = lon, y = lat), color = "red", fill = NA)
```
