Description: Allows plotting data on bathymetric maps using 'ggplot2'. Plotting
  oceanographic spatial data is made as simple as feasible, but also flexible
  for custom modifications. Data that contain geographic information from 
  anywhere around the globe can be plotted on maps generated by the basemap()
  or qmap() functions using 'ggplot2' layers separated by the '+' operator. The 
  package uses spatial shapefiles stored in the 'ggOceanMapsData' package, 
  geospatial packages for R to manipulate, and the 'ggspatial' package to help 
  to plot these shapefiles. High-resolution shapefiles for detailed maps are 
  stored on GitHub and downloaded automatically when needed.
