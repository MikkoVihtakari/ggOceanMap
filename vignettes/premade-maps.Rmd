# General

In addition to the [standard maps](#standard-maps), the ggOceanMaps package contains a possibility to plot premade detailed shapefiles within limited regions the package author has needed in his work. The detailed shapefiles are stored in the [ggOceanMapsLargeData](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMapsLargeData) repository and downloaded as needed. Available shapefiles can be viewed using the `shapefile_list()` function.

```{r}
shapefile_list("all")
```

Plotting shapefiles from the list is done as for any other shapes. Note that the projection of the shapefiles varies.

```{r eval = F}
basemap(shapefiles = "BarentsSea", bathymetry = TRUE)
```

The detailed shapefiles can be **large**. Use the standard basemap data sources to find the limits for your map before you make detailed plots. Exporting to a file is advised over plotting into the plot window. Note that the detailed shapefile approach **generally does not work for large areas**. The solution is sub-optimal and a possibility of plotting raster from WMS is under work.

# Standard map {#standard-maps}

## The default

The default map coming with ggOceanMaps uses decimal degrees and [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/) 1:10m Physical Vectors with the Land and Minor Island datasets combined. The map is transformed to other polar stereographic projections based on limits used in the map. 

```{r eval = F}
basemap("DecimalDegree", bathymetry = TRUE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

## Arctic Stereographic




Standard maps requiring the ggOceanMapsData package are selected automatically based on limits used in the map. You can also use the `shapefiles` argument or the `x` argument as a shortcut to specifically plot these maps (the shortcut requires ggOceanMaps >=1.3.1). Since partial matching is used, you do not need write out the entire name. Only "Arctic" will do for the Arctic stereographic map, for instance.



```{r eval = F}
basemap("ArcticStereographic", bathymetry = TRUE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

## Antarctic Stereographic

```{r eval = F}
basemap("AntarcticStereographic", bathymetry = TRUE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

# GEBCO based maps

## Barents Sea

The Barents Sea and surroundings vectorized from [the GEBCO grid](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/). A subset of IBCAO and GEBCO datasets. Use this one for speed when you can. Replace by IBCAO when your ROI is exceeding the limits of this one. 

```{r eval = F}
basemap("BarentsSea", bathymetry = TRUE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

### The Arctic (IBCAO)

[The IBCAO grid (by GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/about_us/committees_and_groups/scrum/ibcao/) vectorized from the North Pole to approximately 60-65&deg;N. A subset of the GEBCO dataset under. Definitely use this one over the GEBCO alternative whenever you can. It is about ten times faster. 

```{r eval = F}
basemap("IBCAO", bathymetry = TRUE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

### The Northern hemisphere (GEBCO)

The entire GEBCO grid from the North Pole to 10&deg;N vectorized and packed into a >60 Mb R data file. When opened, the data take >3 Gb. This is a clumsy approach and plotting maps using this option can take a long time (up to 10 minutes on a test machine) and will make your computer to beg for mercy. Use this as the last resort and do not blame the package author that you were not warned ;)

```{r eval = F}
basemap("GEBCO", bathymetry = TRUE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

# Geonorge based maps

## Svalbard

The Svalbard map from the [PlotSvalbard](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard) package:

```{r eval = F}
basemap("Svalbard", bathymetry = TRUE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

![The PlotSvalbard maps can also be generated using ggOceanMaps with the ggOceanMapsLargeData extension. The function asks to download the data when you use it for the first time.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMapsLargeData/master/docs/Svalbard.png)

Kongsfjorden from the [PlotSvalbard](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard) package:

```{r eval = F}
basemap(limits = c(10.9, 12.65, 78.83, 79.12), 
        bathymetry = TRUE, shapefiles = "Svalbard",
        legends = FALSE, glaciers = TRUE)
```

# EMODnet based maps

### Northeast Atlantic

1/16 arc-minute map over Northeast Atlantic from [EMODnet](https://www.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/). Might be unfinished. If so and you'll need it, nag the developer.

```{r eval = F}
basemap("EMODnet", bathymetry = TRUE)
```

![The EMODnet bathymetry is still unfinished. Here a map showing a part of the Norwegian coast around Ã…lesund for testing. Vectorization of land shapes from bathymetry has not been implemented yet.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMapsLargeData/master/docs/EMODnet.png)
